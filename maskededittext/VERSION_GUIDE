To get new release, please follow the steps below;

- Update library versions. Increase both versions;

    Path:   maskededittext/build.gradle
                -> versionName & libraryVersion


- Update/Add username and api key in local.properties.
    You should be added as contributor on bintray repo to push new version successfully.
    Otherwise it returns 401;

    Path:   projectFolder/local.properties
                ->bintray.user=[YOUR_BINTRAY_USERNAME]
                ->bintray.apikey=[YOUR_BINTRAY_APIKEY]

            Example;
            bintray.user=myusername
            bintray.apikey=myapikey2183121


- Call below 2 commands on terminal in the following order;
    - ./gradlew install
    - ./gradlew bintrayUpload

Then you can update your implementation version in a minute.
Gradle doesn't suggest you [by highlighting implementation line] to update your version immediately
but as soon as bintray shows your latest version, you can update your implementation version.
